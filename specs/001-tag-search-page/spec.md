# Feature Specification: Tag-Based Content Search Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-tag-search-page`  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a page for people to search content by tags. this page should live at /tags route. All the blog posts have tags as part of their frontmatter which can be used to create a tag cloud which will show on that page by default. Users will be ablet to click on individual tags and once they do, all the posts related to that tag should show up."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-17

- Q: Tag cloud sizing algorithm for displaying tags based on post count → A: Linear scaling (proportional to post count, predictable sizing)
- Q: Empty state handling when no posts match a selected tag → A: Cannot happen since tags are collected from posts themselves
- Q: Tag animation behavior for micro-movements → A: Subtle floating up/down with slight horizontal sway

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse Tag Cloud (Priority: P1)

A visitor wants to discover content topics by exploring an interactive tag cloud that shows all available content categories at a glance.

**Why this priority**: This is the core discovery mechanism that provides immediate value. Users can see what topics are available and get a visual sense of content volume per topic.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting /tags page and seeing an animated tag cloud with all post tags displayed, delivering immediate content discovery value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor navigates to /tags, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see an animated tag cloud displaying all unique tags from blog posts
2. **Given** the tag cloud is displayed, **When** tags have different post counts, **Then** tags scale linearly in size proportional to their post count
3. **Given** the tag cloud is animated, **When** the page is viewed, **Then** tags float subtly up/down with slight horizontal sway to create a cloud-like feel

### User Story 2 - Filter Content by Tag (Priority: P2)

A visitor wants to find all blog posts related to a specific topic by clicking on a tag in the cloud.

**Why this priority**: This provides the core search functionality that turns discovery into actionable content consumption.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking any tag in the cloud and seeing filtered results appear, delivering targeted content access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tag cloud is displayed, **When** a visitor clicks on any tag, **Then** all posts containing that tag are displayed below
2. **Given** filtered results are shown, **When** the results load, **Then** the page automatically scrolls to show the results list
3. **Given** filtered results are displayed, **When** viewing each post entry, **Then** the title, date, and all tags for each post are visible

---

### User Story 3 - View Post Metadata (Priority: P3)

A visitor wants to see comprehensive information about each post in the filtered results to make informed reading decisions.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the browsing experience by providing context, but the core functionality works without detailed metadata.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by filtering posts and verifying that each result shows complete metadata information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** filtered posts are displayed, **When** viewing the results, **Then** each post shows its publication date in a readable format
2. **Given** filtered posts are displayed, **When** viewing the results, **Then** each post shows all its associated tags as clickable elements
3. **Given** post metadata is shown, **When** a visitor clicks on any tag in the results, **Then** the filter updates to show posts for that new tag

### US4: Maintain Filter State Across Navigation (P2)

**As a** content explorer,  
**I want** my selected tag filter to persist in the URL and be restored when I return,  
**So that** I can navigate to posts and return to the same filtered view, and share filtered views with others.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I select a tag from the cloud, **When** the filter is applied, **Then** the URL updates to include ?tag=tagname
2. **Given** I have a filtered view with a URL like /tags?tag=javascript, **When** I click on a post and then use the browser back button, **Then** the filtered view is automatically restored with the same tag selected
3. **Given** someone shares a URL like /tags?tag=css, **When** I visit that URL directly, **Then** the page loads with the CSS tag filter already applied
4. **Given** I'm viewing filtered posts, **When** I click a tag within the results, **Then** the URL updates to reflect the new tag selection

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no blog posts with tags at all (empty tag cloud)?
- How does the system handle tags with special characters or very long names?
- What occurs when the tag cloud contains a very large number of tags (50+ tags)?
- How does the page behave on mobile devices with limited screen space?
- What happens when a user clicks the same tag multiple times?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST create a dedicated page accessible at the /tags route
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract all unique tags from blog post frontmatter automatically
- **FR-003**: System MUST display tags in an animated cloud layout with subtle floating up/down and slight horizontal sway, including subtle shadows for floating effect
- **FR-004**: System MUST make each tag in the cloud clickable to filter content
- **FR-005**: System MUST dynamically render only the filtered posts (not hide/show all posts) with title, date, and all associated tags, matching the styling of the /posts page
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically scroll to results when a tag is clicked
- **FR-007**: System MUST work identically on mobile and desktop with responsive scaling
- **FR-008**: System MUST use semantic CSS layouts without arbitrary sizing values and only use CSS variables defined in variables.css
- **FR-011**: System MUST use Flexbox layout for tag cloud with tight spacing (0.75rem gap) to create organic, masonry-like clustering without rigid grid structure
- **FR-009**: System MUST display all posts for a selected tag without pagination
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow clicking on tags within filtered results to change the filter
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist selected tag in URL query parameter (?tag=tagname) to maintain state across navigation and enable shareable links
- **FR-013**: System MUST restore filtered view when returning to page via browser back button or direct URL access with tag parameter

### Key Entities

- **Tag**: A categorization label from blog post frontmatter, with properties like name, post count, and display weight
- **Post**: A blog entry with metadata including title, publication date, and associated tags
- **Tag Cloud**: A visual representation of all available tags with linear size scaling based on post count frequency

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can discover available content topics within 5 seconds of page load
- **SC-002**: Users can filter to relevant posts within 2 clicks from the tag cloud
- **SC-003**: The page loads and displays the tag cloud in under 3 seconds on standard connections
- **SC-004**: 90% of users can successfully find posts on their desired topic using the tag interface
- **SC-005**: The page displays correctly and functions identically on both mobile and desktop devices
- **SC-006**: Tag animations enhance user experience without causing performance issues or accessibility problems
