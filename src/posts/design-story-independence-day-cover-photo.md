Let's have a look at it first.

Yeah! This is what I came up with when I had to put together myself, India and the Independence Day.

Essentially there were couple of thoughts going on when I fired up Photoshop and had a blank document of size **851 X 315. **I told myself - I am gonna make something today that...

- ...is _Unique_. 'coz I did not want to put the same flat tri-colored flag image as cover photo.
- ...should represent myself, what I love to do.( "_design_" ) and my philosophy ( "_minimalism_" )
- ...should follow modern design trends where you use simple geometric objects to create the image.
- ...finally keeps the feeling of Independence Day intact.

I tried couple of things like **simple gradients, full-width solid colors **and even **simple square tiles **but none of them really made me happy.

After spending "_a lot_" of time on the shapes, I settled down to the one above. I wanted two squares and one circle to represent the Indian flag at it's bare minimum!

Then I had to choose the right colors. I needed the perfect colors for those small shapes on my layers window. So I fired up google and did an image search - "_indian flag"_. Then, I chose some of the best photos out there to analyze the colors used in them. The following colors looked best on a flat white background.

<span class="color-patch saffron">#FC7700</span><span class="color-patch blue">#314294</span><span class="color-patch green">#158809</span>

I was about to save the psd file and export as a .jpeg but it occurred to me that I should put the number of years of independence. Yet again, the color was really important. It should have been mild but sharp on a white background. I chose

<span class="color-patch gray">#666666</span> as my text color.

There it was. I got what I needed. Minimal - Unique - Indian. :)

Show your love by making it your cover photo or use the cropped version below for instagram. Let me know what you thought in the comments below. **Jai Hind!**
