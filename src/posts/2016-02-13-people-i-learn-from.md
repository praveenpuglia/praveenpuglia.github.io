The world of web development is wild. Every day there are literally tons of new things to learn. I feel exhausted time to time and it's really important for one to remain inspired. I like it when I look at work done by people and wonder wide eyed - _How the heck is this done?_. That inspires me.

Following people on Internet has been the key for me to learn new things and experiment with latest and greatest stuff. It's also been a great source of knowledge of future tech. It gave me the opportunity to talk to them time to time and even [meet them](/meeting-lea-and-chris/). Here's a short list of people I follow for their amazing work & everyday tips.

### [Lea Verou](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou)

Following her on twitter did a lot of good to me. She writes about everything in web development world. I often find that the tips she posts laer become some of the real good tools/techniques I ever used.

### [Ana Tudor](https://twitter.com/anatudor)

Wanna learn CSS/SASS and awesome animations? Follow her. She does amazing live coding sessions on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/thebabydino/). That's the fastest way I have found out to learn bunch of new things.

### [Rachel Smith](https://twitter.com/rachsmithtweets)

When I started learning canvas( pretty late and still don't know a ton) and looked for some of the coolest stuff on codepen... [I found her](http://codepen.io/rachsmith/). Her [Hack Physics & JavaScript - 1](http://codepen.io/rachsmith/post/hack-physics-and-javascript-1) really helped me in understanding canvas and physics together.

### [Addy Osmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani)

Every time I come to know about a new feature in Chrome Dev Tools, it's because of him. Following Addy has been amazing for me to know about tooling and performance testing. He also has this [YouTube Series](https://developers.google.com/web/shows/ttt/?hl=en) dedicated to tooling which is cool!

### [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) & [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com)

I don't think Chris needs any introduction. He is one of the most popular folks out there. I have been following Chris & CSS-Tricks since I learned what is box model in CSS. They are like StackOverflow for CSS for me.

### [Una Kravets](https://twitter.com/Una)

I came to know about her a year ago or so. I was totally wowed by her [personal goals repository](https://github.com/una/personal-goals) and the projects she worked upon. Whatever knowledge I have about [CSS blending modes](http://una.im/CSSgram/), I owe it to her.

They are my major source of stuff I work with and care about. I do follow a lot of others who are really amazing. Their work makes me think and rethink and always make me realize that there's more to learn and better ways of solving problems.

**P.S.** - You can look at the list of [people I follow on twitter](https://twitter.com/praveenpuglia/followers) for more. Once you start following some of them, twitter's suggestion will help you a lot.
