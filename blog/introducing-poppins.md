This was the candy I loved as a kid. It was lucrative and distinct because of the eye popping colors. Totally loved it.

I love Sublime Text too and always wanted to make a color scheme for it. It's been real pain to find a nice light theme that comes with clarity. So I remembered Poppins and made a scheme that uses eye popping, high contrast colors on a plain white background for maximum clarity. Obviously, named it Poppins.

It's available on [GitHub](https://github.com/praveenpuglia/color_scheme_poppins) & via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Poppins%20-%20Color%20Scheme). The font used is [Ahamono](https://www.behance.net/gallery/19532783/AhamonoMonospaced)
