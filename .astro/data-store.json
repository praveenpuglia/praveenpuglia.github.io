It's a powerful product with bad design.\n\nI have used a Moto E and a Nexus 5 earlier but never complained on this aspect. There are various points where Redmi falls flat. I know it's a super cheap phone but that does not prevent Xiomi from making it usable.\n\n## Size\n\nIt's a big phone. Bigger than it should be. It's 5.39 inches tall and sports a 4.7 inch screen. Compare that to Nexus 5 which has a 5 inch display but has just about the same (5.43 inches) length. The moment you get the phone out of the box, you know you didn't expect it to be this big. It's also pretty thick. At 0.39 inches, you feel like you are holding a piece of brick.\n\nFYI - I don't have small hands!\n\n## Weight\n\nIt's heavy. Specially if you come from a Nexus 5 background, you can feel the pain. Overall, the size and the weight, combined, makes the phone look like a beast when it should have a posture of a smartphone made for low-end market, for general public.\n\n## Ergonomics\n\nYou won't find the phone comfortable for little things you do. Try this. Try composing a message while you are sleeping. I am sure after a few letters it's going to bang your head and it WILL hurt. Lie down and hold it for a moment. It's going to make your wrist irritated. The curves on the sides make it easy for the phone to slip. I found it bigger for my pocket than I had expected.\n\n## Bezels & Buttons\n\nIf you see, there is a lot of space around the screen which I feel is way too much. If you get your hands on the device, you will feel the same. Below the screen you have almost an inch of space just to have the capacitive touch buttons which is insane! What's more frustrating is that the touch buttons don't glow. I often find myself hitting the back or home button twice or thrice to make sure I get it right. With lights off, there's really no way you can see the buttons. I also find myself often hitting the volume rocker when I am actually looking for the power button. Frustrating.\n\n## The Heating Problem\n\n[I am not the only person complaining about it](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=redmi+1s+overheat). [They have released an update](http://en.miui.com/thread-53432-1-1.html) which claims to solve the issue but I don't see a difference. The phone gets heated up with just 15 minutes of a low-end game play or while it's getting charged. I dare you take it to your ears for a call while it's getting charged.\n\nFrom the build perspective, I am *guessing* the processor is placed somewhere in the upper half of the phone near the speaker. So when it heats, making phone calls become really difficult.\n\n## Summary\n\nIt's not always about getting the best of hardware at a cheaper price. The more you use the phone for the little things you do on a daily basis, you need the phone to help you accomplish the task. The Redmi 1S feels like an obstacle there.","src/content/posts/2014-10-19-xiaomi-redmi-1s-is-a-powerful-product-with-bad-design.md","da316994219d0b05",{"html":115,"metadata":116},"\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/assets/images/2014/10/xiaomi-redmi-1s-quad-core-16ghz-1gb-8gb-47-inch-ips-8mp-camera-dual-sim-wcdma-version-smartphone-black.avif\">\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/images/2014/10/xiaomi-redmi-1s-quad-core-16ghz-1gb-8gb-47-inch-ips-8mp-camera-dual-sim-wcdma-version-smartphone-black.avif\" alt=\"\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s been a while I have been using Xiaomi Redmi 1S and I have a confession to make.

Whatever your answer is, keep that at the back of your mind. I am sure you have reasons! Let me tell you what I use. It's `\u003Ci>`.\n\nIn my conversations with people about html & semantics, over time, this topic has come up too often! For all we know, there isn't a right choice. Not at least from what we have got from the [HTML Spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html).\n\nSo how do we go about choosing an element to deal with icons? I'll say choose as a human would; by being stupid and finding a fit. Religious folks... angry?\n\nPeople use spans stating it's more appropriate \"_semantically\"_. [Here's what W3C says...](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-span-element)\n\n> The span element **doesn't mean anything** on its own, but can be useful when used together with the global attributes, e.g. class, lang, or dir.\n\nWait... what? That's right. It's the \"_meaningless_\" element. This allows you to use it for virtually anything and everything at text level but it's meaningless nonetheless. [The i element is a little different](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-i-element)\n\n> The i element represents a span of text **in an alternate voice or mood**, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a manner indicating a different quality of text, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, transliteration, **a thought**, or a ship name in Western texts.\n\nThis makes more sense to me. Think about it, an icon is essentially a way to depict a piece of text otherwise. Graphically to be precise. It is a thought, a _metaphor_. This specification in fact forces us to be more creative and thoughtful about what \"graphical metaphor\" we should use. In an ideal world, we would be using an `\u003Cimg>`  element to do this but even that has it's own problems; [an empty src makes a server request.](http://www.nczonline.net/posts/2009/11/30/empty-image-src-can-destroy-your-site/)\n\nOn the brighter side, both **icon** and `\u003Ci>`  have \"**i**\" to start with.

I know there's compression, but...\n\n```html\n\u003Cspan>\n  \u003C!-- 13 characters -->\n  \u003Ci>\u003C/i>\n  \u003C!-- 7 characters -->\u003C/span\n>\n```\n\nTalking about screen readers( read _accessibility_ ), neither a `span`  nor an `i`  helps. Almost always, the icons come in the form of CSS `background` . With some mumbo jumbo of `background-position` , we get the stuff done. Some would argue that today's screen readers are habituated to find information like that using span. Don't trust them. [Focus on ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) instead to get rock-solid accessibility.

All gulp tasks reside in this file.\nNow, we create our first task that prints _Hello_ .\n\n```js\n// require gulp. this is why we install gulp locally.\nvar gulp = require(\"gulp\");\n\n// say hello\ngulp.task(\"sayHello\", function () {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n});\n```\n\n- First, we require `gulp` so we can use gulp's API for creating tasks.\n- Next, we create a task using `gulp.task` method with the task name being `sayHello` and an anonymous function that defines what `sayHello` does. In this case, we just print Hello.\n\n## Executing a Task\n\nMost of the work with gulp happens on the command line. To run a task, we navigate to our project directory( or the directory containing `gulpfile.js` ) and ask gulp to run a specific task.\n\n```text\nmy-project\n    /gulpfile.js  \u003C- YOU GOTTA BE WHERE THIS FILE IS\n```\n\n```bash\ncd my-project\ngulp sayHello\n```\n\nDid you see what happened? It might look something like this...\n\n```bash\n$ gulp sayHello\n[15:30:28] Using gulpfile ~/code/my-project/gulpfile.js\n[15:30:28] Starting 'sayHello'...\nHello\n[15:30:28] Finished 'sayHello' after 83 μs\n```\n\nFollowing along? Great!\n\n## Dependent Tasks\n\nIt's easy to make one task wait for another to finish. This is done by passing an array of tasks as the second parameter to `gulp.task` method.\n\n```js\n// say world after saying hello is done\ngulp.task(\"sayWorld\", [\"sayHello\"], function () {\n  console.log(\"World!\");\n});\n```\n\nMove over to terminal and execute `gulp world`.\n\n## The Default Task\n\nIf we move over to terminal and execute `gulp`, without specifying a task name, it looks for a task named `default`. Go ahead! give it a try.\n\n```js\ngulp.task(\"default\", function () {\n  console.log(\"La la la!\");\n});\n```\n\n## Exploring Gulp's API\n\nGulp has 3 other methods `.src`,`.dest` & `.watch` apart from `.task`. We'll look into those by trying to minify CSS, a real world use case for gulp.\n\nBefore we go ahead, we need to know a little more about how gulp works. Gulp generates a stream from the files we pass in via `gulp.src`  method. We then `pipe` the stream through various processors like minify, uglify, sass, sourcemaps etc. Remember, all the processing done, is still on the generated stream and not written to disk. To do that, we use `gulp.dest` .\n\n### Minify CSS\n\nCreate a style.css in css directory and put the following content.\n\n```css\n* {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n}\nbody,\nhtml {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nWe will install [gulp-minify-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-minify-css) plugin to do the minification.\n\n```bash\nnpm install gulp-minify-css --save-dev\n```\n\nIn gulpfile.js, we require this module just like we did it for gulp.\n\n```js\nvar minify = require(\"gulp-minify-css\");\n```\n\n```js\n// minify css\ngulp.task(\"css:minify\", function () {\n  gulp.src(\"css/style.css\").pipe(minify()).pipe(gulp.dest(\"min\"));\n});\n```\n\nSo what did we do?\n\n- We create a new task named `css:minify`  (namespacing is good).\n- We tell gulp which sources to use to build the stream to process using `gulp.src` and passing in the file path.\n- We then `pipe` the generated stream through the `minify` process.\n- Finally, we pipe the processed stream through `gulp.dest` which then writes the new, minified `style.css` inside `min` directory.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is how to watch files for changes. In our example, we'll setup a `watch` task and look for changes in `.css` files. Whenever that happens, we would want the `css:minify` task to run automatically. Here's how.\n\n```js\n// watch for changes in source\ngulp.task(\"watch\", function () {\n  gulp.watch(\"css/style.css\", [\"css:minify\"]);\n});\n```\n\nOn terminal execute `gulp watch`. It may look like the the prompt has hanged but it's actually watching for file changes. Let's go ahead and add some new rules in **style.css**, save it and see what happens!\n\nIn the next post, I'll write about file include patterns, various recipes for doing things like sass compilation, generating sourcemaps, cleaning directories before running tasks and more.

I know. I am late into the business. All cool kids have nailed it completely and I took it up yesterday. But better late than never.\n\nI had tried LESS a little bit, mostly for variables and occasionally for mixins. Never used preprocessing extensively in projects and continued to use the same ol' CSS for everything. I wanted to dive-in. So when it was time to pick one up, I went through [this article](https://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/) and picked SCSS.\n\nNow that SCSS was [the chosen one](https://www.google.co.in/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=the+chosen+one+harry+potter), the instant thought I had was to play around with multiple shadows. It's been one of those things, I always wanted to do. Sadly, it's difficult to write random multiple box-shadows manually. Hence I needed a loop and a shadow generator.\n\n### HTML:\n\nNothing much here. The aim was to use a single element. The **blob**.\n\n```html\n\u003Cspan class=\"blob\">\u003C/span>\n```\n\n### SCSS:\n\nI first created a variable `$shadows` which contained the number of shadows I wanted to create. Then, I created the base styling for the `.blob`\n\n```scss\n/*Number of shadows to generate*/\n$shadows: 1000;\n\n/*our loved blob*/\n.blob {\n  height: 3px;\n  width: 3px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  display: inline-block;\n}\n```\n\nNext, I created a random \u003Cstrong>box-shadow\u003C/strong> generator. I limited the **X and Y offset values to 1920 and 1080** respectively( That's my screen resolution. Still looking for a way to get window height and width in SCSS ). Set the **blur and spread radius** to the same random number and lastly, used random numbers to generate the colors using `rgb()`.\n\n```scss\n@function randomBoxShadow() {\n  $radius: random(50);\n  $shadow: random(1920) + \"px \" + random(1080) + \"px \" + $radius + \"px \" +\n    $radius + \"px rgb(\" + random(255) + \",\" + random(255) + \",\" + random(255) +\n    \")\";\n  @return unquote($shadow);\n}\n```\n\nSee the `unquote()`  in the return statement?. `$shadow`  get's generated as a string. e.g - `\"10px 120px 40px 40px rgb(1,35,145)\"` **with** the quotes. This however can't be assigned to `box-shadow`. Hence we `unquote()` it.\n\nFinally I create a loop for the `box-shadow` inside `.blob`  and call `randomBoxShadow()` within it to get a random shadow every time.\n\n```scss\n$box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #000; /*an initial value for box-shadow*/\n@for $i from 2 through $shadows {\n  $box-shadow: $box-shadow + \",\" + randomBoxShadow();\n}\nbox-shadow: unquote($box-shadow);\n```\n\nCombining all these, the SCSS ended up as follows.\n\n```scss\n$shadows: 1000;\n\n@function randomBoxShadow() {\n  $radius: random(50);\n  $shadow: random(1920) + \"px \" + random(1080) + \"px \" + $radius + \"px \" +\n    $radius + \"px rgb(\" + random(255) + \",\" + random(255) + \",\" + random(255) +\n    \")\";\n  @return unquote($shadow);\n}\n\n.blob {\n  height: 3px;\n  width: 3px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  display: inline-block;\n  $box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #000;\n  @for $i from 2 through $shadows {\n    $box-shadow: $box-shadow + \",\" + randomBoxShadow();\n  }\n  box-shadow: unquote($box-shadow);\n}\n```\n\n...and I was happy!\n\n\u003Cp class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"268\" data-theme-id=\"4977\" data-slug-hash=\"MYzRJX\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"praveenpuglia\">See the Pen \u003Ca href=\"http://codepen.io/praveenpuglia/pen/MYzRJX/\">A blurry world!\u003C/a> by Praveen Puglia (\u003Ca href=\"http://codepen.io/praveenpuglia\">@praveenpuglia\u003C/a>) on \u003Ca href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen\u003C/a>.\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\" async=\"\">\u003C/script>","src/content/posts/2015-03-19-first-scss-experiment-a-blurry-world.md","ac779bef8e260ccd",{"html":271,"metadata":272},"\u003Cp>I know.

theory. Partly because it's brand new and there are things which will take different directions _soon_!\n\nTo demo, I have to create multiple versions of a component. This results in quite a lot of colors directly put into code in the form of **hex codes** or **rgb/rgba** definitions. But! these are demos! Got to get our hands dirty and get them done quick.\n\nThen comes the hard part. Finding all the colors we used throughout the project and see how we screwed it up( kind of! ). That finding part is tricky if you plan to open up each stylesheet and look into it. A good part of the problem is to recognize different types of color definitions you have.\n\n> **Sublime Text to the rescue!**\n\nWe all know how powerful Sublime's search is. We can use regular expressions to match up specific strings in our projects. All we need are the regex for different color formats.\n\n**HEX COLOR :** `#([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})`  \n**RGB/RGBA COLOR :** `(rgba?\\((\\d+),\\s*(\\d+),\\s*(\\d+),?\\s*(\\d*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\))`  \n**HSL/HSLA COLOR :** `(hsla?\\((\\d+),\\s*([\\d.]+)%,\\s*([\\d.]+)%,?\\s*(\\d*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\))`\n\nNow, we have to use it in the find tool. This is easy. We combine all the above expressions using the `|` ( OR ) operator and search for it.\n\n- \u003Ckbd>Ctrl\u003C/kbd> + \u003Ckbd>Shift\u003C/kbd> + \u003Ckbd>F\u003C/kbd> to open up the find and replace tool.\n- \u003Ckbd>Alt\u003C/kbd> + \u003Ckbd>R\u003C/kbd> to enable regular expressions search.\n- Enter `\u003Cproject>` as **Where**.\n- Combile the expressions above using the `|` operator.\n- \u003Ckbd>Find\u003C/kbd>\n\nWe'll see something magical! In the **Find Results** tab, all colors are highlighted. But not selected. Here's how to do that.\n\n- Open up the find tool. \u003Ckbd>Ctrl\u003C/kbd> + \u003Ckbd>F\u003C/kbd>. This time we just want to search the **Find Results** tab content.\n- Search using the same regex combination.\n- \u003Ckbd>Ctrl\u003C/kbd> + \u003Ckbd>Enter\u003C/kbd> or click **Find All**.\n- Copy and paste the selected occurrences in a new tab.\n\n\u003Ciframe style=\"width:100%; height:350px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ZpdpmWjZck\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\nNice! So we have all the colors but wait! we have also copied duplicate colors. By that I mean the occurrence of same string that represents a color. We can now take some JavaScript help( **Set** ).\n\n> A **Set** is a collection of _distinct_ objects.\n\nWhat we are doing here is...\n\n- Making an array of all colors, including the duplicate ones.\n- Making a set out of that array of colors.\n- Converting that set back to array and putting each color in a new line.\n\n```javascript\nArray.from(new Set(/*ARRAY_OF_COLORS*/)).join(\"\\n\");\n```\n\n\u003Ciframe style=\"width:100%; height:350px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERx2J3lfHlw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\nVoila! We have got all the unique color strings in our project. Good thing is, if there are multiple strings representing the same color, we can now identify them easily.\n\nExample - `#fff Vs. #ffffff Vs. rgb(255,255,255)`.\n\nMy initial thought ended here and I was happy but that didn't last long. The problem that remainned was that I still couldn't see those colors. Sure we have all the values but in the field of colors, seeing them makes more sense.\n\nSo... I built this tool - [chamarel](http://praveenpuglia.com/chamarel)( couldn't find a 'cool' name :( ). You can input the list of all colors, including the duplicate ones, in this tool and it shows you, **visually**, the unique\u003Csup>#\u003C/sup> colors! It's far from perfect but try it out! I have plans to make it easier to use so you don't have to do the heavy lifting.

We use them everyday in colors( e.g `rgb()/hsl()`), backgrounds( e.g. `linear-gradient()`), animations(e.g. `cubic-bezier()`) etc. CSS Values and Units Module Level 4 defines the [`toggle()`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#funcdef-toggle) function. Let's take a look.\n\nSay we have the following markup.\n\n```html\n\u003Cdiv>\n  Level 1\n  \u003Cdiv>\n    Level 2\n    \u003Cdiv>Level 3>\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\nNow what we want is different text colors for those divs at different levels. What can we do?\n\nWe can probably do something like this.\n\n```css\ndiv {\n  color: red;\n}\ndiv > div {\n  color: green;\n}\ndiv > div > div {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nThis is already bad because of increasing specificity and getting messier. We could make it a little better by adding classes to the divs indicating the nesting level and then style accordingly.\n\n```html\n\u003Cdiv class=\"level-1\">\n  Level 1\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"level-2\">\n    Level 2\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"level-3\">Level 3>\u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\n```css\n.level-1 {\n  color: red;\n}\n.level-2 {\n  color: green;\n}\n.level-3 {\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nThis gets our job done but we are writing a lot of code. We can see how we would have to write more rules as soon as we added more levels.\n\n### What if we want to repeat those same colors, in that order, for further nested elements?\n\nWhat that means is that\n\n- `.level-4` would have the color `red`.\n- `.level-5` would have `green`.\n- `.level-6` would be `blue`.\n- `.level-7` would be `red` again and so on.\n\nIf we were to do this the way we did before, we would have to add too many rules.\n\nSCSS or LESS could make it easy for us to just run a loop and generated all those rules but still our final CSS would end up having too much of WET code. Also, one would have to know the number of levels beforehand.\n\nThis way of solving the problem also breaks when we increase the level of nesting on the fly because we won't have a rule for the new level.\n\n### What do we do?\n\nWelcome the CSS toggle() function.\n\nThe [spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#funcdef-toggle) defines it as follows.\n\n> The toggle() expression allows descendant elements to cycle over a list of values instead of inheriting the same value.\n\nWith `toggle()`, we can solve our problem like this.\n\n```css\ndiv {\n  color: toggle(red, green, blue);\n}\n```\n\nNeat! But...\n\n### Woah! What the hell just happened?\n\nThe `toggle()` function has the following syntax.\n\n```css\nproperty: toggle(value1, value2, value3...);\n```\n\nEach argument passed to `toggle()` is first evaluated as if it was the **only** value applied to property. This gives CSS engine the respective computed values.\n\n```\nvalue1 --> computedValue1\nvalue2 --> computedValue2\nvalue3 --> computedValue3\n```\n\nNext, the browser finds out which `computedValue` matches the `inherited` value of `property`.\n\nSay `computedValue1` matches the inherited value of `property` then, the next value (`computedValue2`) will be resolved as the value for `toggle()`.\n\nIf the inherited value matches `computedValue3`, `computedValue1` gets resolved as the value to be applied.\n\n### What happens if a duplicate value is used?\n\nHaving duplicate values in a toggle function may short circuit it. Here's an example.\n\n```css\np {\n  margin-top: toggle(10px, 20px, 10px, 30px);\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, 30px value is never reached because...\n\n- When inherited value is 10px, 20px resolves as the value of toggle function.\n- When inherited value is 20px, the next value, which is 10px get resolved.\n- The next value in the list is 10px but that from 1 we know what it resolves to.\n\nSo...\n\n```css\np {\n  margin-top: toggle(10px, 20px, 10px, 30px);\n}\n\n/*becomes*/\n\np {\n  margin-top: toggle(10px, 20px);\n}\n```\n\n### Real World Example\n\nSay we want an unordered list with a specific order of bullets in mind, for different levels of the list. A square bullet at level 1, a disc at level 2 and a circle at level 3. Something like this...\n\n![List with custom bullet styles.](/assets/images/2017/toggle-list.avif)\n\nHere's how we can do it.\n\n```html\n\u003Cul>\n  \u003Cli>Item 1\u003C/li>\n  \u003Cli>Item 2\u003C/li>\n  \u003Cul>\n    \u003Cli>Item 3.1\u003C/li>\n    \u003Cli>Item 3.2\u003C/li>\n    \u003Cul>\n      \u003Cli>Item 3.3.1\u003C/li>\n    \u003C/ul>\n  \u003C/ul>\n\u003C/ul>\n```\n\n```css\nul {\n  list-style-type: toggle(square, disc, circle);\n}\n```\n\nIsn't that cool?\n\nThe saddest part is, however, that it's not supported in any of the browsers and it also doesn't seem like a priority to browser vendors for implementation.\n\n### Resources\n\n- [https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#funcdef-toggle](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#funcdef-toggle)\n- [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=715070](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=715070)","src/content/posts/2017-04-25-css-toggle-function.md","f0636d13e72cc980",{"html":400,"metadata":401},"\u003Cp>CSS has had \u003Ca href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/indexes/#functions\">functions\u003C/a> for a long time now.

I'll make the blobs squares of reducing sides using SCSS.\n\n```scss\n@for $i from 1 through 20 {\n  .blob:nth-child(#{$i}) {\n    //From Basics: the body parts need to move at different time for the slithering effect\n    // the delay increases from upper body to lower body\n    animation-delay: $i * 0.1s;\n\n    //start with 20px as sides. As $i increases, the dimensions reduce.\n    width: 21px - $i;\n    height: 21px - $i;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAt this point, all you'll see is this.\n\u003Cimg style=\"display: block; margin: auto\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"Snake's Body\" src=\"/assets/images/2017/snake-1.avif\" />\n\n### The Animation\n\nLooks like our snake's body is set and all the body parts are now centered on the page. I have also given the `animation-delay` to each of the `.blob`s.\n\nWhat about the animation?\n\nYou see, it's easy to trick human eyes. If we move each blob horizontally the same amount, with same time duration but a little bit of gradually increasing delay, it feels like it's moving like a snake.\n\nDon't believe me? Here's the video again. Keep your cusor on one of the blobs and you'll see that it only moves horizontally.\n\n\u003Cvideo width=\"50%\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" controls src=\"/assets/videos/2017/snake-final.webm\">\u003C/video>\n\nSo let's do that.\n\n```css\n@keyframes blob {\n  50% {\n    transform: translate3d(40px, 0, 0);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI am moving each blob `40px` towards **X** axis at `50%` of the animation from it's original position(i.e. when X translate is 0. In our case that's the horizontal center of `body`). Remember the negative translate I applied earlier? That was done to make the overall snake appear at the center of the screen. Here's how it works.\n\n```\n// Movement of a blob.\nStart          Original Pos.          End\n-40px -------------- 0 -------------- 40px\n-------------------Repeat-----------------\n```\n\nA `.blob` starts at `-40px`. Reaches `40px` at `50%` of the animation and then finishes off at it's original position `0` at 100% of the animation( If no 100% state is specified, the default state becomes the final state. )\nAll in all, it looks like each blob is oscillating between `-40px` & `40px` positions.\n\nLet's apply this animation to all the `.blob`s.\n\n```css\n.blob {\n  /*...*/\n  animation: blob 1.3s cubic-bezier(0.785, 0.135, 0.15, 0.86) infinite;\n}\n```\n\n- Each blob takes 1.3 seconds to complete the animation.( `animation-duration` )\n- `cubic-bezier(0.785, 0.135, 0.15, 0.86)` specifies the `animation-timing-function`. If you don't know what that is, head over to [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function).\n- The animation is going to run `infinite`ly (`animation-iteration-count`);\n\n## Putting it all together!\n\n\u003Cp data-height=\"300\" data-theme-id=\"4977\" data-slug-hash=\"XRBwGp\" data-default-tab=\"css,result\" data-user=\"praveenpuglia\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"Funny Snake Loader 🐍\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen \u003Ca href=\"http://codepen.io/praveenpuglia/pen/XRBwGp/\">Funny Snake Loader 🐍\u003C/a> by Praveen Puglia (\u003Ca href=\"http://codepen.io/praveenpuglia\">@praveenpuglia\u003C/a>) on \u003Ca href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cscript async src=\"https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\u003C/script>\n\nIf you want, you can fork the pen and play around with different properties of the blob and make your own variant of the snake!

If you are gonna be at MetaRefresh and wanna know about Grids, go vote! 😊\n\nBack to the topic...\n\nGrid has areas. We can define the entire layout with area names and ASCII art.

Something like this...\n![Two column layout using CSS Grid areas](/assets/images/2017/grid-reuse-1.avif)\n\nWhat's great about area names is that we can reuse them. Confusing? Let me give an example.\n\nSay we are creating a comments section for a blog which has to look like this.\n![Comments section from a typical blog](/assets/images/2017/grid-reuse-2.avif)\n\nAnd if we add a little bit of borders, we see how the grid should be constructed.\n![Comments layout with grid lines](/assets/images/2017/grid-reuse-3.avif)\n\nIt's clear that the avatar and the comment(input/text) is used exactly the same way in both the places. So, we should be able to create two grids, both of which can dedicate a place for avatar and the comment.\nHere's what I mean.\n![Depicting areas.](/assets/images/2017/grid-reuse-4.avif)\n\nHere's how that might look in code.\n\n```html\n\u003C!-- Comment Area -->\n\u003Cdiv class=\"comment-input\">\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"avatar\">\u003C/div>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"input\">\n    \u003C!-- in real world, there'll be a text area in here! -->\n    Your comments here...\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003C!-- Comment List -->\n\u003Cul class=\"comment-list\">\n  \u003Cli class=\"comment-item\">\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"avatar\">\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"comment\">Your comment...\u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"meta\">few minutes ago... by Praveen Puglia\u003C/div>\n\n    \u003C!-- Nested Thread -->\n    \u003Cul class=\"comment-list\">\n      \u003Cli class=\"comment-item\">\n        \u003Cdiv class=\"avatar\">\u003C/div>\n        \u003Cdiv class=\"comment\">Your comment...\u003C/div>\n        \u003Cdiv class=\"meta\">few minutes ago... by Someone Else\u003C/div>\n      \u003C/li>\n    \u003C/ul>\n    \u003C!-- Nested Thread Ends -->\n  \u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n```\n\n... & relevant CSS.\n\n```css\n.avatar {\n  grid-area: avatar;\n  height: 64px;\n  width: 64px;\n}\n/* Comment Input */\n.comment-input {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 64px 1fr;\n  grid-template-areas: \"avatar comment\";\n}\n.input {\n  grid-area: comment;\n}\n\n/* Comment List */\n.comment-list {\n  /* To make sure that nested threads take up the entire width of the grid. */\n  grid-column-end: span 2;\n}\n.comment-item {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 64px 1fr;\n  grid-template-areas:\n    \"avatar comment\"\n    \"meta meta\";\n}\n.comment {\n  grid-area: comment;\n}\n.meta {\n  grid-area: meta;\n}\n```\n\nThings to notice,\n\n- We declared two grids which greatly describe the relation among different elements.\n- We totally reused the area names `avatar` and `comment` among the grids.\n- We reused the `.avatar` element in both the places.\n- We created two different elements `.input` & `.comment` which belong to the same area in both the grids but we still can style them individually.\n\nTo me, grid, in this case and many more like it, is doing a great job at establishing relationships among elements used on page and making it easy to understand for humans.\n\nHere's the final demo!\n\n\u003Cp data-height=\"324\" data-theme-id=\"4977\" data-slug-hash=\"PJPMOJ\" data-default-tab=\"html,result\" data-user=\"praveenpuglia\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"A Generic Comments Section - Using CSS Grids\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen \u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io/praveenpuglia/pen/PJPMOJ/\">A Generic Comments Section - Using CSS Grids\u003C/a> by Praveen Puglia (\u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io/praveenpuglia\">@praveenpuglia\u003C/a>) on \u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cscript async src=\"https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\">\u003C/script>","src/content/posts/2017-09-18-reusing-areas-in-css-grid.md","3fcac1a15786537e",{"html":500,"metadata":501},"\u003Cp>I have been playing around with CSS Grids for some time now and it has been an extremely delightful experience.

use cases. Nothing too fancy but nothing too simple.\n\nI have been using Angular 2( or 4, 5 ...), now called just Angular, for more than a year now. I don't hate it but I don't like it at all. Not my thing. At work, I am still required to use it but that's about it. If I am asked to choose a framework to build something new, it won't be my choice.\n\nI liked Angular JS( Angular 1.x ) a lot. I know the performance problems it had( has ). I was THE person in my company who was excited about the next iteration(...turned out to be an incarnation) of Angular to see what the team comes up with. Alas, I am disappointed.\n\nIf you are from India and have heard about the book, [The Rozabal Line](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9471031-the-rozabal-line) you would know that it's particularly not a good read. In fact, I could never finish it up and a piece from the comments for the book kind of sums up my feelings about it.\n\n> ...this has been a novel which made me resolve never to buy a novel just because u liked another one from the author - [...read more](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/300408702?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1);\n\nThat's how I feel about Angular.\n\nBut this post is not about Angular. It's about Vue. And it's AWESOME. In my front end life, I have tried many other frameworks, libraries and I am confident that I never liked anything as much. It's one of those tools you always wanna have and it makes you feel super confident.\n\n## Why?\n\n### No Terminology Bloat\n\nI never told why I never liked that book. I didn't because it was too hard to follow. Every second page a new character would pop into existence out of nowhere. It's hard to stich the story together. It's impossible to understand what's important.\n\nThis is one of the biggest areas where Angular sets me off and Vue shines. You know JavaScript? A little bit of HTML? Great! You can get started right now.\n\nIn Angular, the eco system is built around( primarily ) TypeScript. The API surface is just too big for anyone who wants to start. You gotta know what an `NgModule` is. Oh it's different from the ES Modules. You gotta know Decorators. Classes etc. Even before you get to that _Hello World_, there's lot you need to understand, even if at a surface level. It has steep learning curve which I am going to discuss in a minute.\n\nIn Vue, a plain ol' `\u003Cscript>` tag, a function and an object can get you to that Hello World. Unlike Angular it doesn't ask you to already know a ton of stuff. The **barrier to entry** is negligible.\n\nExample -\n\n```html\n\u003C!-- From the official Vue Guide -->\n\n\u003Cdiv id=\"app\">{{ message }}\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://unpkg.com/vue\">\u003C/script>\n\n\u003Cscript>\n  var app = new Vue({\n    el: \"#app\",\n    data: {\n      message: \"Hello Vue!\",\n    },\n  });\n\u003C/script>\n```\n\n### On Point Documentation\n\nI think we all agree on one thing. A great documentation makes the developers feel right at home. What's better than a great documentation is a documentation that focuses on examples, on point, with code and that's it. It knows when to move to the next topic. Your examples shouldn't need to depend on metaphors.\n\nIf you have ever watched Lynda.com tutorials and Laracasts or Egghead videos you would know that the latter two are great choices. Why? Their videos are short, on point and less demanding.\n\n### The Beautiful, Elegant API\n\nHave you looked at Vue's API? I think it's easily one of the best APIs out there. Here's something I totally agree with.\n\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\u003Cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Good API design = making the simple case easy and the complex one possible.\u003Cbr>Just like good UIs. After all, an API *is* a UI, just not a GUI.\u003C/p>&mdash; Lea Verou (@LeaVerou) \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/598298784389443584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2015\u003C/a>\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cscript async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\">\u003C/script>\n\nVue totally nails it. It's intuitive. It describes what it does easily and has delightful tiny things that make you love it. Here are some examples.\n\n#### Creating A Vue Instance\n\n```js\nnew Vue({\n  data: {\n    // Data goes here.\n  },\n  methods: {\n    // Methods go here.\n  },\n  // Need some computed properties? Yeah you guessed it right.\n  computed: {},\n  // What about filters?\n  filters: {},\n  // You want to watch a property?\n  watch: {},\n});\n\n// you see where I am going with this?\n```\n\nNow that you know this, you already know most of the components API. Here's an example\n\n```js\nlet MyComponent = Vue.component({\n  name: \"my-component\",\n  template: `\u003Ch1> Hello World! \u003C/h1>`,\n  data() {\n    return {};\n  },\n  methods: {},\n  computed: {},\n  filters: {},\n});\n```\n\nThe only things that you need to know are...\n\n- A component requires a `name` so you can use the component like `\u003Cmy-component>\u003C/my-component>`\n- A template so your component can render a piece of DOM.\n- `data` becomes a function that returns an object. So each instance of `MyComponent` can have separate data.\n\nThat's it. Rest of the things work exactly how we have seen while creating a Vue instance.\n\nI also like how Vue team has gone ahead and added little things that may seem unimportant at first but over time, help you to be productive. Here are some examples.\n\n```html\n\u003C!-- Delightful event modifiers. -->\n\n\u003C!-- Wanna prevent default when the event fires? -->\n\u003Cform @submit.prevent=\"onSubmit\">\u003C/form>\n\n\u003C!-- How about stopping the propagation? -->\n\u003Cbutton @click.stop=\"onButtonClick\">\u003C/button>\n\n\u003C!-- Binding an event just once? -->\n\u003Ca @click.once=\"doThis\">\u003C/a>\n\n\u003C!-- How about something should happen when you press Enter? -->\n\u003Cinput @keyup.enter=\"submit\" />\n```\n\n```html\n\u003C!-- Want the number input to give you a real number? -->\n\u003Cinput type=\"number\" v-model.number=\"age\" placeholder=\"Your Age\" />\n\n\u003C!-- The `age` property in `data` will be a number instead of the default string -->\n```\n\nRead throughout the [template syntax](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html) and you'll see that the API is written to be extremely intuitive and readable.\n\nI personally feel that any APIs should be made so simple that they stop you from your recurring visit to the documentation. You shouldn't need to think too hard to figure this out. Vue checks the right boxes there.\n\n### Progressive Nature\n\nOne of the biggest reasons that I don't find myself to be liking Angular a whole lot is beacuse it's built primarily for enterprise apps / large apps in mind. The point they miss is that most developers start small. They fail at things and they require help.\n\nHere's a quick challenge. How fast can you create a reduced test case demo for a problem in Angular and share it via JSBin or JSFiddle or CodePen? Try that!\n\n### Error Messages\n\nSay, in your template, you used a property that doesn't exist on the `data` section of your VM. If you are using Vue in development mode, you'll see great error message along with a link to the documentation to read more about that.\n\n![Vue human & debugging friendly error message](/assets/images/2018/vue-error.avif)\n\nVue is full of examples like that and except for a few, I haven't found an error message that adds to my confusion.\n\nIf you remember Angular JS(1.x), it used to include link to docs too. In Vue, it's just way better.\n\nTry finding your way though the shiny new Angular with the entire stack trace and 30 of them being traced at `zone.js`.\n\n### Extra Help When Needed\n\nSo you are working on an app and now you have made a deployable version of it. You have used it with the local server and it now has to work with nginx.\n\nYou'll suddenly realize that the HTML5 History mode you used during routing doesn't play well anymore. nginx needs to know how to do handle that so vue-router can work as expected.\n\nThis is a pretty scenario and folks who make Vue know it. This is exactly why they just didn't end up at saying something like\n\n> \"Hey! If you wanna use the HTML5 History mode with these kind of servers, you have to know how to configure them. Go Google!\".\n\nInstead, they made a [specific section in the documentaiton](https://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/history-mode.html) showcasing configurations for commonly used servers so you don't have to run around.\n\nNeat right?\n\n### First Class Support\n\nVue team knows that frontend development is more than just the view layer. Just like the core library, there are supporting libraries, all made by the Vue core members, to help developers accomplish most real world use cases. If you love the Vue documentation, you can expect the same level of thoughts gone into API design and documentation.\n\n- **vue-router** - For all the routing needs\n- **vuex** - Vue's Flux like implementaiton for state management.\n- **vue-rx** - For RxJS integration with Vue.\n- **vue-cli** - Your one stop shop for scaffolding and developing apps from tiny to large enterprise ones.\n- **TypeScript Support** - Vue has official typescript support if you are comfortable with it.\n- **vue-loader** - So YOU can use Single File Components and WEBPACK can do it's magic to figure out different parts of `.vue` files.\n\n## Try It\n\nAll in all, Vue really is a piece of software for people to understand, get up and running faster and build scalable frontend focused applications.\n\nTo me, it's the API and the documentation that stands out than anything else. As Lea Verou have said and emphasized on a million times.\n\n> APIs should make simple easy and complex possible.\n\nVue delivers on this and probably that's why it has been able to pass the **Early Adopters** phaze in the lifecycle of a product.\n\nGive it a try and I am sure you won't be let down. 🖖","src/content/posts/2018-04-06-why-vue-is-so-awesome.md","7cea59e2068f0b61",{"html":521,"metadata":522},"\u003Cp>…and Angular is not.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Disclaimer\u003C/strong> - These are my personal thoughts AFTER using both of them to solve real world use cases.

Say we have a global set of SCSS variables that we might need to reference in our `.vue` single file components.\n\nLets say, those variables are located at `src/_variables.scss` and the file looks like this.\n\n```scss\n//_variables.scss\n\n// COLORS\n--------------------------\n$brand-primary  : #bada55;\n$brand-secondary: #666666;\n```\n\n## The Basic Solution\n\nSince we are great at relative paths, we would go to say `src/components/Hello.vue` and import the variables like so.\n\n```scss\n@import \"../scss/variables\";\n```\n\nor if we want the variables in `src/components/admin/Dashboard.vue` we would import it like...\n\n```scss\n@import \"../../scss/variables\";\n```\n\nand then we can refer to `$brand-primary` in our components. That works!\n\n## The Better Solution\n\nThe problem with the above approach is evident.\n\n- It's clumsy.\n- Real world applications have much deeper levels.\n- Bad for maintenance.\n\nWe can easily fix this by using [Webpack Aliases](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/). What we are essentially doing there is that we are creating a special word for webpack to recognize and resolve that to a path of our choice.\n\nSo we go to `webpack.base.conf.js` and look for `alias`. We add an entry for our `src/scss` directory as follows.\n\n```js\nalias: {\n    ...,\n    '$scss': resolve('src/scss')\n}\n```\n\nNow, we can go back to `src/components/Home.vue` and change the import statement to\n\n```scss\n@import \"~$scss/variables\";\n```\n\nand guess what?

Example:\n\n- filters\n- data processing functions\n- common event handlers etc.\n\nFilters are slightly special because they can be used in both the component definition in script and the corresponding template. Sometimes exclusively in the script without any usage in the templates. In those cases, it does not feel right to bring in the utility functions as an entire mixin.\n\nSo, I write the functions separately and then export a mixin that references those functions.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```ts\n// src/utils/datetime.ts\n\n// Export individual function\nexport function getDurationByMillis(millis: number) {\n  if (millis \u003C 0) {\n    millis = 0;\n  }\n  let seconds: any = Math.floor((millis / 1000) % 60);\n  let minutes: any = Math.floor((millis / (1000 * 60)) % 60);\n  let hours: any = Math.floor(millis / (1000 * 60 * 60));\n  hours = hours \u003C 10 ? \"0\" + hours : hours;\n  minutes = minutes \u003C 10 ? \"0\" + minutes : minutes;\n  seconds = seconds \u003C 10 ? \"0\" + seconds : seconds;\n  return `${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`;\n}\n\n// Export Mixin\n@Component({\n  filters: {\n    duration: getDurationByMillis,\n    anotherFilter: anotherFunction,\n  },\n})\nexport default class TimeUtils extends Vue {}\n```\n\nIf you remember the [Revealing Module Pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript) this should look similar.\n\nIn the JS world, the mixin export looks simpler.\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  filters: {\n    duration: getDurationByMillis,\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIn components where I need to convert millis to duration, only in the script, I just import the `getDurationByMillis` function instead of the entire mixin.\n\n```ts\nimport { getDurationByMillis } from \"@/utils/datetime.ts\";\n```\n\nI also put any constants that I need for my datetime utilities in that same utility file as well. Example -\n\n```ts\nexport const DATE_FORMAT_LONG = \"DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:ss\";\nexport const DATE_FORMAT_SHORT = \"DD/MM/YYYY\";\n```\n\nI can even export multiple small mixins from the same file. Example - one for just **date** related utilities and another for **time** utilities.\n\nI feel this has couple of benefits.\n\n- All the utility functions / constants those functions use are co-located.\n- Imports become explicit for script-only usages.\n- Filter functions become much more reusable.\n- Maintenance becomes much easier and with little bit of work these utility functions become consumable in other projects too.\n\nHope this helps you out.","src/content/posts/2019-04-09-managing-mixins-and-utils-in-vue.md","b0f6c9a3e8b10e6c",{"html":606,"metadata":607},"\u003Cp>I have been working quite a bit with \u003Ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue.js\u003C/a> and I have sort of found a sweet spot for how to manage utilities in a Vue project.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I often use mixins to share utility functions and constants related to those utilities across components.

We also use Vue with TypeScript. Naturally, we need type definitions for everything the endpoints expose.\n\nWe end up needing both the schema from an [Introspection Query](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) and the types to use in TypeScript land. The schema is used to build a tool that dynamically builds a UI for running queries / mutations from the UI itself based on the parameters they accept. More on the tool may be in a later post.\n\nWe have an opinionated setup and like to have our types generated in a certain way. Examples -\n\n- Enums should be UPPERCASE and separated by underscores.\n- We prefer interfaces over types.\n\nWe keep the generated types & schema at **/src/graphql/types** directory.\n\nWe use **.env** file to store the endpoint details in environment variables. This not only helps us with schema generation but also with the [Vue Apollo](https://apollo.vuejs.org/) setup.\n\n[GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) helps us with all of this.

It plays nice with multiple graphql endpoints as well since all we have to do to is add an entry in **.env** file and re-run the script.\n\nWe also use some [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) magic for colorful logging in console.\n\nHope this helps and if it does, do let me know in the comments.","src/content/posts/2021-01-26-my-graphql-schema-types-generation-workflow copy.md","b75854177b5c31c7",{"html":650,"metadata":651},"\u003Cp>At \u003Ca href=\"https://voicezen.ai\">Voicezen\u003C/a>, we use multiple GraphQL endpoints.

Generally it would ideally be the file where we define all our variables related to the project.\n\nFor simplicity, let's say we are dealing with colors and want all the theme colors to be made available in JavaScript.\n\n```scss\n// colors.scss\n\n/*=============================================\n=            Black, White, Grays            =\n=============================================*/\n\n$--color-black: #000000;\n$--color-charcoal: #212121;\n$--color-abstract: #5c5c5c;\n$--color-slate: #737373;\n$--color-earth: #ababab;\n$--color-edge: #e7e7e7;\n$--color-mercury: #f0f0f0;\n$--color-seashell: #f7f6f5;\n$--color-fairy: #f7f7f7;\n$--color-white: #ffffff;\n\n/*=====  End of Black, White, Grays  ======*/\n```\n\nNow, to have the exact same thing exported we are going to use Webpack's magic export from the Sass file itself, which looks like this.\n\n```scss\n:export {\n  black: $--color-black;\n  charcoal: $--color-charcoal;\n  abstract: $--color-abstract;\n  slate: $--color-slate;\n  earth: $--color-earth;\n  edge: $--color-edge;\n  mercury: $--color-mercury;\n  seashell: $--color-seashell;\n  fairy: $--color-fairy;\n  white: $--color-white;\n}\n```\n\nLastly, we can simply import the colors.scss file in JavaScript and use the colors.\n\n```jsx\nimport colors from \"colors.scss\";\n\nconsole.log(colors.black); // #000000\n```\n\nThat's it! Ain't that great?\n\n- You don't need to repeat hex values in both styles and script\n- You can choose which variables to expose.\n- You don't need a complicated system / process to get the results.\n\nHope that helps!","src/content/posts/2021-01-24-import-sass-variables-in-javascript-with-webpack.md","5a37a849b080a1da",{"html":671,"metadata":672},"\u003Cp>Wouldn’t that be great?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We can define the entire theme in Sass files and then when we need to have them in our JavaScript, we can use them without having to redeclare them in a JSON?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First, let’s create a Sass file with a bunch of variables.

But what does it mean to be white-labelled?\n\n> A **white-label product** is a [product](\u003Chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)>) or service produced by one company (the [producer](\u003Chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(economics)>)) that other companies (the [marketers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing)) [rebrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebranding) to make it appear as if they had made it. - Wikipedia\n\nWe serve the same product to multiple clients with various needs and to their users, it should look like as if the client company made it. This requires paying attention to a bunch of things like\n\n- Brand colors.\n- Typography.\n- Logos.\n- Other aspects of theming.\n- Nomenclature customization.\n- **Sitle title / PWA installer customization etc**\n\nToday, I am briefly going to touch upon how we achieve the last one. I'll probably write more about the other points in later posts.\n\nWe chose to tackle the last point first because that's the immediate and persistent thing that users notice when they open any app on browser. The title stays on the tab as long as they are on the app so it makes sense to start there.\n\nIf the app is a PWA, it becomes necessary to get the illusion right by making sure that the browser prompt for the app installer reflects the client's title and logo.\n\nOn the engineering side, it means that we have to dynamically generate the manifests for our PWA, the logos, the title etc.\n\nWe use [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and along with that the [Vue CLI PWA Plugin](https://cli.vuejs.org/core-plugins/pwa.html). The first step is to have the assets / app-icons for each client in a separate, public directory. With a Vue CLI project we get a root level `public` directory. Here's what that looks like after our changes.\n\n```bash\n.\n├── img\n│   └── icons\n│       ├── batman\n│       │   ├── android-icon-144x144.png\n│       │   ├── android-icon-192x192.png\n│       │   ├── android-icon-36x36.png\n│       │   ├── android-icon-48x48.png\n│       │   ├── android-icon-72x72.png\n│       │   ├── android-icon-96x96.png\n│       │   ├── apple-icon-152x152.png\n│       │   ├── favicon-16x16.png\n│       │   ├── favicon-32x32.png\n│       │   └── favicon.ico\n│       ├── superman\n│       │   ├── android-icon-144x144.png\n│       │   ├── android-icon-192x192.png\n│       │   ├── android-icon-36x36.png\n│       │   ├── android-icon-48x48.png\n│       │   ├── android-icon-72x72.png\n│       │   ├── android-icon-96x96.png\n│       │   ├── apple-icon-152x152.png\n│       │   ├── favicon-16x16.png\n│       │   ├── favicon-32x32.png\n│       │   └── favicon.ico\n│       └── default\n│           ├── android-icon-144x144.png\n│           ├── android-icon-192x192.png\n│           ├── android-icon-36x36.png\n│           ├── android-icon-48x48.png\n│           ├── android-icon-72x72.png\n│           ├── android-icon-96x96.png\n│           ├── apple-icon-152x152.png\n│           ├── favicon-16x16.png\n│           ├── favicon-32x32.png\n│           └── favicon.ico\n├── index.html\n└── robots.txt\n```\n\nWe have 2 clients and then the `default` client which is a fallback. We'll talk about that in a bit.\n\nThe next piece of the puzzle is to identify which client are we building the dist for. For that, we use `.env` files. When we build our application, we specify the client by adding the following in our `.env.production` file.\n\n```text\nVUE_APP_CLIENT_ID=batman\n```\n\nFor convenience, we have created a bunch of `.env.CLIENT.local` files so we can build client specific dists without having to modify `.env.production` again and again.\n\n```bash\n.env.batman.local\n.env.superman.local\n```\n\nIn each of these we set `NODE_ENV=production` and the `VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID` to their respective IDs. This allows us to do something like this.\n\n```bash\n# generate production dist for batman\nyarn build --mode=batman\n```\n\nNote that our icon directory name matches the `VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID` variable.\n\nThe next part is to use this ID to resolve things like\n\n- What should be the human readable title for this client?\n- Which icons should be put into the manifest?\n- Which colors to use? etc.\n\nFor this, we use a simple map that gives us all the necessary information.\n\n```js\n// client-metadata.js\nexport const clientMetadata = {\n  batman: {\n    title: \"The Dark Knight!\",\n    colors: {\n      primary: \"#080808\",\n      accent: \"#AE8875\"\n    }\n  },\n  superman: {\n    title: \"Man of Steel\",\n    colors: {\n      primary: \"#bb070e\",\n      accent: \"#0099f7\"\n    }\n  },\n  default: {\n    title: \"Voicezen\",\n    colors: {...}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this, we now move to our final setup which is to instruct Vue CLI to genreate all the stuff necessary for a particular client.\n\n```js\n// vue.config.js\n\n// we use this package to get the current git hash.\nconst { gitDescribeSync } = require(\"git-describe\");\n\nconst allClientsMetadata = require(\"./src/assets/client-metadata.json\");\nconst clientId = process.env.VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID ?? \"default\";\n\n// get the metedata.\nconst clientMetadata = allClientsMetadata[clientId];\n\n// notify which client we are working with\nconsole.log(`🚀 Building for Client : ${clientMetadata.title}`);\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  // setup pwa plugin options\n  pwa: {\n    name: clientMetadata.title,\n    workboxPluginMode: \"InjectManifest\",\n    workboxOptions: {\n      // since we use InjectManifest option, we provide our own\n      // service worker to start with.\n      swSrc: \"./src/sw.js\",\n      swDest: \"service-worker.js\",\n    },\n    manifestOptions: {\n      short_name: clientMetadata.title,\n      icons: [\n        {\n          src: `img/icons/${clientId}/android-icon-36x36.png`,\n          sizes: \"36x36\",\n        },\n        {\n          src: `img/icons/${clientId}/android-icon-48x48.png`,\n          sizes: \"48x48\",\n        },\n        {\n          src: `img/icons/${clientId}/android-icon-72x72.png`,\n          sizes: \"72x72\",\n        },\n        {\n          src: `img/icons/${clientId}/android-icon-96x96.png`,\n          sizes: \"96x96\",\n        },\n        {\n          src: `img/icons/${clientId}/android-icon-144x144.png`,\n          sizes: \"144x144\",\n        },\n        {\n          src: `img/icons/${clientId}/android-icon-192x192.png`,\n          sizes: \"192x192\",\n        },\n      ],\n      background_color: \"#ffffff\",\n      display: \"standalone\",\n    },\n    themeColor: clientMetadata.colors.primary,\n\n    iconPaths: {\n      favicon32: `img/icons/${clientId}/favicon-32x32.png`,\n      favicon16: `img/icons/${clientId}/favicon-16x16.png`,\n      appleTouchIcon: `img/icons/${clientId}/apple-icon-152x152.png`,\n    },\n    assetsVersion: gitDescribeSync().hash, // this allows easy cache-busting\n  },\n};\n```\n\nHere's what the input service worker file looks like.\n\n```js\n// src/sw.js\n\n/* eslint-disable */\n// This is the code piece that GenerateSW mode can't provide for us.\n// This code listens for the user's confirmation to update the app.\nself.addEventListener(\"message\", (e) => {\n  if (!e.data) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  switch (e.data) {\n    case \"skipWaiting\":\n      self.skipWaiting();\n      break;\n    default:\n      // NOOP\n      break;\n  }\n});\n\nworkbox.core.clientsClaim(); // Vue CLI 4 and Workbox v4, else\n// workbox.clientsClaim(); // Vue CLI 3 and Workbox v3.\n\n// The precaching code provided by Workbox.\nself.__precacheManifest = [].concat(self.__precacheManifest || []);\n// workbox.precaching.suppressWarnings(); // Only used with Vue CLI 3 and Workbox v3.\nworkbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute(self.__precacheManifest, {});\n```\n\nThis setup ensures that our PWA manifests and assets are generated for the client we are building the dist. You can tweak the PWA plugin configuration to add more details for different browsers and platforms.\n\nMore reading -\n\n- [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers)\n- [Workbox Webpack Plugin](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin)","src/content/posts/2021-07-17-white-labeling-vue-cli-pwa.md","be9bce90f9be2377",{"html":719,"metadata":720},"\u003Cp>At \u003Ca href=\"https://voicezen.ai/\">Voicezen\u003C/a>, I have been fortunate enough to work on a platform that has to be white-labelled.

Purists do come in and tell me - \"Why? Why can't you write a known abbreviation as an abbreviation in things you name?\"\n\nBecause I am a frontend engineer, people also send me examples of the browser native classes / constructors like `HTMLDivElement` and ask me why, as a web engineer, don't I follow the same in the code I write.\n\n# Reasons\n\n## Abbreviation are Known\n\nThis assumption is false.\n\nIf you are a web developer, you would probably know about **HTML** or **CSS** as known abbreviations but beyond that, it's not guaranteed that you would know the _business abbreviations_ that your code is going to be more tied with.\n\nI work at smallcase(at the time of this writing), a fintech company. Any new member that joins the team probably wouldn't have ever made their journey into investing yet. Should I expect them to know that when someone says [**cagr**(ˈkāgə-ˈr)](https://youtu.be/44abVtgmT1U?t=20) they actually mean CAGR(Compound Annual Growth Rate) or Nav could be navigation or NAV which is Net Asset Value. There's more…\n\n- GST( Goods and Services Tax )\n- AMC( Asset Management Company )\n- LAS( Loan Against Securities )\n- MFC ( MF Central )\n\n…and so on.\n\nThe list of business specific abbreviations are huge and while you should work your way up understanding business terms, they don't need to confuse you while you code.\n\n## It's Always More Readable\n\nAgain, this is false too.\n\nWhen looking at the `HTMLDivElement` example, a purist might tell that that's more readable because the `HTML` part is immediately noticeable. But it doesn't always work out that way.\n\nIf I take the purist point of view, `JSONAPIResponse` should be the one that's used but is it really readable? `JsonApiResponse` reads much better!\n\n## The Native APIs Use It. Why Not Us?\n\nBrowsers are being built from a long long time. They have legacy reasons to write things the way they do and it matters that the APIs they provide are consistent. It also means that they can't suddenly decide on shipping APIs that follow **StrictPascalCase.**\n\nBut **we** don't have to do that! The interfaces that we interact with from the libs land can remain as is on the libs land but our own types, interfaces, classes etc can follow StrictPascalCase and remain consistent across our codebase.\n\n## StrictPascalCase is Free of Mental Overhead\n\nWhat I really like about this is that I or my team members don't have so pronounce things the same way to be able to write them in the same way. [**cagr**(ˈkāgə-ˈr)](https://youtu.be/44abVtgmT1U?t=20) or C-A-G-R, in either case you end up writing `Cagr` . You don't have to worry about multiple abbreviations fusing together, like `DOMAPI`, and confuse it with uppercase constants / enums you may write.\n\nIt liberates you from all of that and helps everyone in the team be consistent with naming without putting too much of brain into it.\n\n# Summary\n\nIt's not a new thing but every now and then someone in your team might walk up to you and tell that you should just use the abbreviations in your symbols. They have their reasons but tell them how using StrictPascalCase makes lives easier for everyone.\n\nThere has been online [debates and discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/ge0yo5/is_it_still_recommended_to_pascalcase_acronyms/) on this [time and again](https://github.com/mediamonks/frontend-coding-standards/issues/9) but it's hard to deny the simplicity afforded by StrictPascalCase.\n\nSo go make StrictPascalCase your friend.","src/content/posts/2024-08-06-case-for-strict-pascal-case.md","b15c1c158eff558c",{"html":741,"metadata":742},"\u003Ch1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>There has been countless pull requests where I have been asked to do the following and I have systematically denied the request.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code github-light\" style=\"background-color:#fff;color:#24292e; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"diff\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B31D28\">\u003Cspan style=\"user-select: none;\">-\u003C/span> ImpsData\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#22863A\">\u003Cspan style=\"user-select: none;\">+\u003C/span> IMPSData\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>or\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code github-light\" style=\"background-color:#fff;color:#24292e; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"diff\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B31D28\">\u003Cspan style=\"user-select: none;\">-\u003C/span> UserApiResponse\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#22863A\">\u003Cspan style=\"user-select: none;\">+\u003C/span> UserAPIResponse\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>I personally prefer \u003Ccode>ImpsData\u003C/code> over \u003Ccode>IMPSData\u003C/code> and similarly \u003Ccode>UserApiResponse\u003C/code>.

The app version & the hash of the currently deployed code are two of those critical things.\n\nI recently added this to a [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) / [React](https://reactjs.org/) app but the same can be done for any Vite based app. Here's what I did.\n\n## Creating Global Constants\n\nVite allows us to create global constants via `vite.config.ts`'s `define` section.\n\n```ts\nexport default defineConfig({\n  define: {\n    __APP_VERSION__: \"\",\n    __COMMIT_HASH__: \"\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\nMore about `define` [here](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#define).\n\nTo make TypeScript aware of these global constants, I needed to define them in `vite-env.d.ts` file. I could also create an `env.d.ts` file and define them there as prescribed in the Vite docs.\n\n```ts\ndeclare const __APP_VERSION__: string;\ndeclare const __COMMIT_HASH__: string;\n```\n\n## Getting App Version\n\nNow that I had the global constants ready to use, I needed to find a way to get the app's current version. Usually, this comes from the `version` field in `package.json` so I picked it up from there.\n\n```ts\n// vite.config.ts\nimport packageConfig from \"./package.json\";\n\npackageConfig.version; // \"1.0.0\"\n```\n\nWhile doing this, I also got a TypeScript error telling me I can't import a JSON file here. For that to work, I had to modify **tsconfig.node.json**\n\n- add `\"resolveJsonModule\": true` in `compilerOptions`\n- add `\"package.json\"` in `include` array.\n\nThat did the trick.\n\n## Getting the Commit Hash\n\n```ts\n//vite.config.ts\nimport * as child from \"child_process\";\nconst commitHash = child.execSync(\"git rev-parse --short HEAD\").toString();\n```\n\n## Updating Global Constants\n\nI initially just assigned the `packageConfig.version` and `commitHash` values directly to the constants in define like this.\n\n```ts\nexport default defineConfig({\n  define: {\n    __APP_VERSION__: packageConfig.version,\n    __COMMIT_HASH__: commitHash,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThis broke the build because these values weren't interpreted as strings. Reading the documentation for `define` revealed that the values are interpreted as raw expressions. In order to use the values as strings, I had to stringify them using `JSON.stringify()`.\n\n```ts\nexport default defineConfig({\n  define: {\n    __APP_VERSION__: JSON.stringify(packageConfig.version),\n    __COMMIT_HASH__: JSON.stringify(commitHash),\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Creating the Secret Page\n\nThis was as simple as creating a route entry for a path like `__dev__` and rendering a simple component with the global constants.\n\n```tsx\n// Router.tsx => Uses React Router 6.\n\u003CRoute path=\"__dev__\" element={\u003CDevInfo />} />\n```\n\n```tsx\n// DevInfo.tsx\nexport default function DevInfo() {\n  return (\n    \u003Ccode>\n      \u003Cstrong>{__APP_VERSION__}\u003C/strong> at {__COMMIT_HASH__}\n    \u003C/code>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThat's all. Now I can go to `/__dev__` route and access this information for any deployment of my app.","src/content/posts/2023-01-06-secret-page-dev-info-vite-react.md","849bd734da639b77",{"html":785,"metadata":786},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/images/2023/app-version-git-hash.avif\" alt=\"Adding a secret page for developers with app version &#x26; commit hash in a Vite.js / React app\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I love bare bones health pages / system info pages which give you critical information about your application in the fastest possible way.

Most of my CLI tools & programs are available on Homebrew. Makes it very easy to install a ton of packages in one go. \n\nOver the years, I have learnt to store vital configurations in a [dotfiles](https://github.com/praveenpuglia/dotfiles) repository. You should [read this old blog post](https://blog.smalleycreative.com/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/) and do it too! \n\nWhen I setup my system, I download this repo and the first thing to run is \n```sh\nbrew bundle install\n```\nThis picks up the `Brewfile` and installs all the packages I have listed in it. Read more about [how Homebrew Bundle works](https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile).\n\n## Terminal\nI have gone through the phases of using [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/), [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), and now [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org/). I also tried [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) for a while but it always felt too bloated & slow. It now has [AI built in](https://www.warp.dev/warp-ai) which is already too much AI everywhere at this point. \n\nI have settled on WezTerm because it is a modern terminal emulator that is easy to configure and has a lot of features. Most importantly, it's lean, clean and has low CPU & Memory footprint. It also uses Lua for configuration which is a very nice language to work with. \n\nI store my WezTerm configuration in the [same dotfiles repository](https://github.com/praveenpuglia/dotfiles/blob/master/wezterm.lua). Simply copying this to `~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua` does the job.\n\nI have a few custom keybindings to split the terminal into multiple vertical / horizontal panes, navigate left and right around commands etc. You can find them in the config file itself. \n\n## Shell\nI have been a long term fan of ZSH because of the [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) framework. It supercharges my shell workflows. \n\nmacOS now comes with ZSH by default so you don't have to install it separately but in case you don't have it, you can install it via Homebrew.\n\nMy configuration is available [here](https://github.com/praveenpuglia/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc) but you may not need all of it - things like the environment variables and path changes. Modify as needed.\n\nI do wanna talk about some of the plugins I use because they make life easier. \n\n### [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)\nThis plugin provides suggestions for commands as you type. It's a great way to speed up your workflow.\n![zsh-autosuggestions](/assets/images/2025/zsh-autosuggestions.png)\n\n### [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)\nThis plugin provides syntax highlighting for your shell commands. If a command doesn't exist, it gets highlighted in red.\n![zsh-syntax-highlighting](/assets/images/2025/zsh-syntax-highlighting.png)\n\n### [z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z)\nThis plugin provides a way to navigate to frequently used directories. Example, if I need to go to `~/code/github`, I simply type `z github` and it takes me there. The longer the path the quicker it feels. \n\n\u003Cvideo src=\"/assets/images/2025/zsh-z.mp4\" autoplay loop muted playsinline>\u003C/video>\n\n### [git-extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras)\ngit-extras has a lot of useful tools & aliases that make git workflows super easy. For example - \n- `git undo` - Undo the last commit\n- `git delete-branch \u003Cbranch-name>` - Deletes both the local and remote branch\n\nYou can take a look at the full list of commands [here](https://github.com/tj/git-extras/blob/main/Commands.md).\n\n## Prompt\nI love [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). It's a no-nonsense, fast prompt with a lot of customizability. Make sure to enable [transient prompt](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#transient-prompt) if you are using it. \n\nMy configuration is available [in the same repository](https://github.com/praveenpuglia/dotfiles/blob/master/.p10k.zsh). If you are copying it, you'll need to place it in `~/.p10k.zsh`.\n\n## Misc CLI Tools & Aliases\nSome of my favorite CLI tools & aliases.\n\n### Tools\n\n- **[eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)** : eza is a modern replacement for ls. It's a lot faster and has a lot of features.  \n- **[micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro)** : I couldn't ever get used to working with Vim. Thankfully Micro exists with sensible defaults, keyboard shortcuts, syntax highlighting and more. \n- **[volta](https://volta.sh/)** : I use Volta to manage my Node.js versions. NVM is popular but Volta is lean and clean. It seamlessly integrates into your node projects via `volta` config in `package.json` and if you have a pinned node / npm version, it'll automatically switch to that version when you go into your project directory. \n- **[fkill](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fkill-cli)** : I don't like googling that command to figure out process ID and then kill it using `kill -9 \u003Cpid>`. fkill is just more convenient.\n- **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)** : Ever used arrow keys to find that one command you couldn't fully remember? Or tried the default `Ctrl+R` to search through your command history? fzf is a better alternative. It has fuzzy search to get you to the right command at lightning speed.\n- **[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)** : I love downloading videos from YouTube for offline viewing, especially when I am on a plane / train. YT-DLP is amazing for this. It can download videos, music, subtitles in various quality. I even have an alias for it mentioned below. \n\n### Aliases\n```sh\n# zshrc management\nalias zc=\"micro ~/.zshrc\"\nalias zs=\"source ~/.zshrc\"\n\n# use eza when typing ls\nalias ls=\"eza\"\nalias la=\"eza --icons -la\"\n\n# because this is needed a lof of times\nalias nuke=\"rm -rf node_modules\"\n# recursively kills all node_modules. Helpful when freeing up space\n# and also migrating to a new system without having to copy\n# gazillion files\nalias boom=\"find . -name \"node_modules\" -exec rm -rf '{}' +\"\n\n# kill process\nalias k=\"fkill -v\"\n\n# git additional \nalias gdl=\"git delete-branch\"\n\n# yt-dlp alias for downloading videos from YouTube in the best possible quality\n# along with all the subtitles\nalias ytd='yt-dlp --output \"./%(title)s/%(title)s-[%(id)s].%(ext)s\" --all-subs -f \"bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/mp4\"'\n```\n\n## Apps\n\n- **[AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)** : It's an oldie but a goodie. Mac doesn't have a native uninstaller that can purge all the files & configurations when an app is uninstalled. AppCleaner is a great tool to do that. If you installed an app via Homebrew, `brew uninstall` should do the job. If you are using AppCleaner, make sure you turn **Smart Delete** on. \n\n\u003Cimg width=\"400\" src=\"/assets/images/2025/appcleaner-smart-delete.png\" alt=\"AppCleaner Smart Delete\">\n\n- **[Bandwidth+](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandwidth/id490461369?mt=12)** : Nifty little menu bar tool that shows upload and download speeds.\n- **[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)** : The best password manager I have ever used.
